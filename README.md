# COS301 Longsword Navigation

Implementation phase for the NavUP system, COS301, University of Pretoria.

This is the repository for the Navigation module of team Longsword. Team Longsword is building the NavUP system for the Android platform. The project for Longsword will be completed in Java. Navigation will manage the databases for: User Preferences for routes, Custom pins dropped by users, a cache of all recent routes. Navigation also provides an interface for calculating a route. If the route isn't in cache, the GIS module is called to return a calculated route.
